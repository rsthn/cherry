# Cherry Gamedev Library (JS)

## Installation

You can use npm to install the library, or download the standalone `cherry.js` file from the `dist` folder and include it in your index.html file.

```sh
npm i @rsthn/cherry
```

## Getting Started

If you'd like to build your projects from NodeJS (as is the new norm lately) just make sure you install some bundler (i.e. WebPack, Browserify). We prefer the browserify and watchify combination because it is lightweight and quite easy to use.

Our skeleton "Getting Started" project along several other samples can be found here:
