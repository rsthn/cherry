## Installation

You can use npm to install this library, or download the standalone `cherry.js` file from the `dist` folder and include it in your index.html file directly. When using the latter a global object named `cherry` will be available.

```sh
npm i @rsthn/cherry
```

<br/>

## Getting Started

If you'd like to build your projects using NodeJS just make sure you install some bundler (i.e. WebPack, Browserify, Parcel). We prefer the parcel in case you wonder.

Our skeleton "Getting Started" project along several other samples can be found here:
