	<span>Cherry is a gamedev library.</span>
</p>

<br/>

## Installation

You can use npm to install this library, or download the standalone `cherry.js` file from the `dist` folder and include it in your index.html file directly. When using the latter, a global object named `cherry` will be available.

```sh
npm install @rsthn/cherry
```

<br/>

## Getting Started

If you'd like to build your projects using NodeJS just make sure you install some bundler, we use `parcel-bundler` but any other should do (i.e. WebPack, Browserify, etc).

Our skeleton "Getting Started" project along several other samples can be found here:
